# Study Room For You - Redesigned
Completely overhauled the look and feel of the website [Study Room For You](https://studyroom4u.com/).

Created using `bootstrap 4.5` and some `css` styling.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` using [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) or [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Normally opening `index.html` will not work.

## Fonts used
* [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
* [Libre Baskervile](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville)
* [Baloo Da 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+Da+2)
